# YHack-2020

Intro 

Problem: 
a) Differently minded communities are unlikely to interact in a non-confrontational way.
b) We currently are highly unlikely to meet new people outside our existing community or friend-group with the ongoing pandemic regulations.

Parameters:
Use the app to get matched with someone with a different opinion or ideology.
Begin the conversation from the safety of anonymity while engaging in a debate with your opponent. 
The goal is not to simply discredit your opponent, but to open their eyes to who you are as a person and from where you are coming from in this conversation. 

The End goal.
Make a new connection to someone you might not initially agree with. 
Bridge the rift that has been created between the opinion camps in today's society, one person at a time. 



Philosophy and how it works

In today's strange world, the ongoing pandemic keeps us isolated to not just our own homes. With our social life put on hold, most of our interactions have moved online. With algorithms strictly dictating our daily experience, our content is meticulously curated for minimal resistance and agitation. 

Stuck in our personal-bubbles, our world has grown apart. We have been categorized and filed into involuntary collectives, in which we spent our online experience with people that the algorithm has deemed the same. Unable to reenact the chance encounters of our real world, we are unlikely to cross paths or clash with differently minded online users in a meaningful way. 

Our social interaction between the pockets of opinions has devolved into endless provocations and conflicts in anonymous comment sections and forums.  

This idea aims to break free of the hoards of online trolls and offensive online battles. You have an opinion and so do other people. We pair you with your arch-nemesis penpal. Using our chat program, you can have both: the intimacy of a private chat and the comfort of anonymity with a twist. To ensure a civil and engaging conversation, we have conceived a non-linear chat that gives you both the safe space and the tools to fully engage in a meaningful discussion with your counterpart. 

Once Paired, you will engage in a turn-based discussion with your anonymous pen pal. However, in this debate, there is no winner or loser. Over time your anonymity will fade to reveal the person behind the argument. This love-hate relationship is a commitment that needs nourishment; thus, you will only be able to engage in a single conversation at a time until it is resolved. To ensure some form of agency, the time to answer the chat is limited to X amount of time. 

While it is essential to keep the bigger goals of the discussion in mind, a natural conversation goes on tangents. To make this experience more engaging than you usual back and forth (A B A B) chat window, you will be able to start "branches" that grow outwards of your main conversation. At some point, one might have multiple branch threads run simultaneously to the main discussion. 

However, our application's overarching goal is not to be the ultimate solution but a first step. We aim to firstly create unlikely connections between polar opposite people and give them the tools to ease into a long-lasting conversation and potentially new unlikely friendships.
